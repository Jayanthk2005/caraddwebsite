        <p>The Government of India established Maruti Udyog Limited in February 1981 as a joint venture with Suzuki Motor Corporation as a small partner. The Government of India partially departed the business in 2003 and then sold all of its remaining shares to Suzuki Motor Corporation in 2007..Maruti Suzuki is undeniably the leading car manufacturer in India.
            With a wide range of models catering to different budget segments, Maruti Suzuki has established itself as a trusted brand over the years.
            Here are some key reasons why Maruti Suzuki is arguably one of the best car companies in India.</p> 
        <h2>2) Hyundai</h2><br>

        <p>“We are going forward on our one-million production target and sometime in 2025, the production at Talegaon plant will start... We have grown by 9 per cent last calendar year and our market share grew 0.1 per cent last year... We want to further go up in market share, introducing new products and Talegaon plant will be very supportive towards that,” Tarun Garg, Chief Operating Officer, told reporters here.The Maharashtra government has recently assured that all 900 ex-workers of GM would get a compensation of ₹25 lakh each and eligible candidates would also be absorbed in the new company.When asked about the developments from the GM workers’ union side, its President, Sandeep Bhegade, said that around 900 ex-employees are right now at a negotiation stage with the GM management for a swift transfer</p><br>
        <h2>3) Toyota</h2><br>

        <p>Japanese car giant Toyota is gearing up for a fiery re-entry into the Indian sub-4-metre SUV segment, with the “Urban Cruiser Taisor”. This new offering, expected to launch within the first quarter of 2024, marks a strategic move for Toyota, capitalising on its successful alliance with Maruti Suzuki. The Taisor will be based on the popular Maruti Fronx, a stylish and capable crossover. However, unlike a simple rebadge, the Toyota will get subtle cosmetic tweaks to distinguish itself. Think reprofiled bumpers, unique headlamp and DRL combo, and possibly distinctive alloy wheels. Inside, expect the shared dashboard layout to be adorned with Toyota’s signature touches in upholstery and colour options.Under the hood, the Toyota crossover will get two engine options: a 1.2-litre naturally aspirated Dualjet unit and a 1.0-litre Boosterjet turbocharged mill. The former delivers 89 bhp, paired with either a 5-speed manual or AMT gearbox. The latter belts out 99 bhp, and it will come with a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed torque converter automatic. Toyota might also consider a CNG option, similar to its Maruti counterpart.</p>
